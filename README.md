# article-scraper

**article scraper** is a full-stack application that scrapes articles from the front page of nytimes.com, returning titles with brief descriptions, if available, and a link to the article. A user may save an article to a reading list, and add notes to it. It uses Node.js and Express server, MongoDB and Mongoose for modeling, Handlebars for templating, and Cheerio for scraping.
